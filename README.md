# .NET Projects - Dating App
A dating app made using ASP.NET and Angular. Part of my ongoing series of ASP.NET web applications.

## Getting Started
### API Server:
```bash
$ cd API  # Navigate into API directory
$ dotnet watch run  # Activate the ASP.NET API server
```
**NOTE:** Make sure you are using .NET 6 since this project is built with it.

### Client:
```bash
$ cd Client  # Navigate into Client directory
$ ng serve  # Activate the Angular client server
```
